        <p> Asparagus and eggs make the best spring breakfast or a beautiful light lunch. Asparagus is cooked in a pan with a little oil, and topped with two eggs.  
        </p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Olive oil</li>
                <li>Garlic</li>
                <li>Asparagus</li>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat a small skillet over medium-high heat. Add olive oil and garlic; cook and stir until garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds. </li>
                <li>Add asparagus and cook until fork-tender, turning asparagus often to ensure even cooking, about 4 minutes.  </li>
